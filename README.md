This project presents a detailed analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in India using a dataset that includes daily updates of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases across all states and union territories. The primary goal of this project is to visualize the progression and impact of the virus through a Tableau dashboard for better understanding and decision-making.

The dataset (covid_19_india.csv) provides structured case data, while the Tableau workbook (Covid_19_India.twb) transforms this data into interactive visualizations. These dashboards highlight key insights such as trends over time, regional comparisons, recovery and mortality rates, and patterns of spread.

This project is ideal for data analysts, public health researchers, students, and anyone interested in exploring how COVID-19 evolved in India during the pandemic.
